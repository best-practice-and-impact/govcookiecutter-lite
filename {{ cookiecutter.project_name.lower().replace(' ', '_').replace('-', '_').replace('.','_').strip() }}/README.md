## Getting started

To start using this project, first make sure your system meets its
requirements.

It's suggested that you install this package and its requirements within
a virtual environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ installed
- a `.secrets` file with the required secrets and credentials
- to have [loaded environment variables][docs-loading-environment-variables] from `.env`

Contributors have some additional requirements - please see our [contributing guidance][contributing].

## Installing the package

Whilst in the root folder, in a terminal, you can install the package and its
Python dependencies using:

```shell
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
pip install -e .
```

### Install for contributors/developers

To install the contributing requirements, use:
```shell
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

This installs an editable version of the package. This means that when you update the
package code you do not have to reinstall it for the changes to take effect.
This saves a lot of time when you test your code.

Remember to update the setup and requirement files inline with any changes to your
package.
